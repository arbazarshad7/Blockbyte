# Blockbyte

## Project Description

Blockbyte is a cutting-edge decentralized file storage and sharing platform built on Ethereum blockchain technology. The project leverages smart contracts to provide a secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant file management system. Unlike traditional cloud storage services, Blockbyte gives users complete control over their data through blockchain-based ownership and access management.

The platform integrates with IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for distributed file storage while maintaining metadata and access controls on-chain. This hybrid architecture ensures both data permanence and efficient storage utilization. Users can upload files, control access permissions, share content with specific individuals, and track file usage statistics—all without relying on centralized authorities.

## Project Vision

Blockbyte envisions a decentralized digital future where data sovereignty belongs to individuals rather than corporations. Our mission is to democratize file storage and sharing by creating an open, trustless, and globally accessible platform that empowers users with:

- **Complete Data Ownership**: Users maintain full control over their files without intermediaries
- **Censorship Resistance**: Immutable storage that cannot be arbitrarily restricted or removed
- **Privacy Protection**: Advanced access controls and encryption capabilities
- **Global Accessibility**: Universal access to files from anywhere in the world
- **Transparent Operations**: All interactions recorded on blockchain for full auditability
- **Community Governance**: Decentralized decision-making for platform evolution

We aim to build the foundation for Web3 file storage infrastructure that supports the next generation of decentralized applications and services.
